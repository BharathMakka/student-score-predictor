## 📊 Dataset

A small sample dataset containing study hours and corresponding scores.

| Hours | Scores |
|-------|--------|
| 2.5   | 21     |
| 5.1   | 47     |
| ...   | ...    |
| 1.1   | 17     |

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Data Loading
2. Data Visualization (scatter plot)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Splitting into Train/Test
5. Model Building using Linear Regression
6. Prediction and Visualization
7. Evaluation using MSE, R² Score
8. Custom Prediction (e.g., for 6.5 study hours)
